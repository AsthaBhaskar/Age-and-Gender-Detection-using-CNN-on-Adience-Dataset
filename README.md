# Age-and-Gender-Detection-using-CNN-on-Adience-Dataset

## Problem Statement
The problem statement is to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model that can accurately detect the age and gender of individuals in images from the Adience dataset. The Adience dataset consists of a diverse range of faces of different ages and genders, captured under different lighting conditions and facial expressions, making it a challenging dataset for age and gender detection. The objective is to design a CNN architecture that can learn meaningful features from the images and classify them into the correct age and gender categories with high accuracy. The proposed model should be able to handle variations in facial expressions, lighting conditions, and other factors that can affect the performance of the model. The ultimate goal is to develop a robust and accurate age and gender detection system that can be used in real-world applications such as marketing, security, and entertainment.



## Dataset
The Adience dataset is a benchmark dataset for age and gender classification, consisting of images of faces collected from the web. The dataset includes approximately 26,000 images of 2,284 subjects, ranging in age from 0 to 100 years and including both males and females. The images were captured in unconstrained conditions, meaning that the subjects were not posed or controlled for lighting, facial expression, or other factors.

The images are organized into five different subsets based on the age and gender of the subjects: (1) faces of infants (0-2 years old), (2) faces of children (2-13 years old), (3) faces of adolescents (13-21 years old), (4) faces of adults (21-45 years old), and (5) faces of seniors (45-100 years old). Each subset contains a roughly equal number of male and female subjects.
